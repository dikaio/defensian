# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Constitutional Analysis and Monitoring System (Defensian)

### 1. Executive Summary

The Constitutional Analysis and Monitoring System is a Go-based application designed to analyze existing laws and monitor proposed legislation for potential violations of the US Constitution. The system will provide a social media interface on X (formerly Twitter), allowing users to submit inquiries about constitutional questions through mentions to a dedicated handle (@*). Defensian will be distributed as a compiled binary with an embedded SQLite database, enabling easy deployment while maintaining powerful analysis capabilities.

### 2. Product Vision
